# company_commute

An app displaying all the company&#x27;s employees&#x27; commutes. This app is entirely built with flutter.

## What it is all about

This project demonstrates an use case for using flutter as technology for app development.
_Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase._ 

The idea is to match a company's employee's commutes.
An employee can enter her / his address and sees on a map the commute's waypoints and the waypoints of others. 

This project supports Android, iOS and Web. 
The project was initially started to learn about Flutter for mobile devices. 
The initial plan was to build an app for Android / iOS. We enhanced the idea with web once Mockingbird was announced.

It is - also for prototyping purposes - backed by a dart [backend]("https://github.com/adorsys/company-commute-backend").
